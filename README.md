# *Credit Risk*

## Introduction
Credit risk refers to the probability of loss due to a borrower's failure to repay any type of debt. Credit risk management is the practice of mitigating losses by assessing the adequacy of a bank's capital and loan reserves at any given time. This process has long been a challenge for financial institutions.

While it's impossible to predict exactly who will default on their obligations, proper assessment and management of credit risk can significantly reduce the severity of losses. The interest payments received from the borrower or issuer of a debt obligation represent the compensation investors earn for taking on credit risk.
